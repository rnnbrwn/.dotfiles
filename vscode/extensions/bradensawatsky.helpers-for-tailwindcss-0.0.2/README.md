# Helpers For TailwindCSS

This is an extremely simple extension I created to make some common tasks easier when working with TailwindCSS. I am not in any way associated with Tailwind Labs Inc.

## Features

The following features are added to your context menu and command palette:

1. Extract selected *classes* to an **@apply** statement for a css component inside the **tailwind components layer**
*Note:* Replaces selected classes with new parent class name
2. Extract selected *HTML* to a **functional** vue component. 
*Note:* Replaces current selection with the newly created component tags
3. Open the TailwindCSS website inside a web panel view in the editor
4. Open the TailwindCSS Playground website inside a web panel view in the editor

### Bugs

Please create an issue in the repository if a bug or undesired functionality is found. If you want to help out, create a pull request with the code! I will review it as soon as possible.

### Future of the extension

This is an extremely simple extension to start. I am fully willing to put more effort in to add to its feature set and give it more use among fellow developers.
Feel free to email bradensawatsky@gmail.com with any suggestions or create an issue on this github repository.

**Enjoy!**
